Life Expectancy 2000-2015, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrec99/life-expectancy-2000-2015).
The dataset was buit merging different sources, in order to join revelant features to data analysis. 
_Note: the merge is available on Kaggle, the exploratory data analysts team did not realized this process._

Observations: 

- Global Life Expectancy increased in the observed period, but the biggest part of Africa still presents a life expectancy under 60 years old, a worrying scenario that shows inequality of life quality between the continents that have not really changed since 2000;
- Only Europe and Oceania presented increasement on their forest area.

Observations: 

- Countries on top 10 are the same on both periods.
- Until 2015, China was the most populous country, but India population has been increasing significantly through the years, factor already observed by the scientists. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, India will surpass China as the world’s most populous country next year (2023);
- Only Ethiopia and Congo Democratic Republic are part of top 10 countries with most population difference and are not between the most populous ones;
- Mexico and Russian Federation are between top 10 most populous contries but are not between the ones with most population difference.
